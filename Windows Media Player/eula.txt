MICROSOFT SOFTWARE SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE TERMS

SOFTWARE SUPPLEMENT FOR MICROSOFT WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM

Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) licenses this supplement to you.  If you are licensed to use Microsoft Windows operating system software (for which this supplement is applicable) (the "software"), you may use this supplement.  You may not use it if you do not have a license for the software.  You may use this supplement with each validly licensed copy of the software. Microsoft provides support services for this software as described at www.support.microsoft.com/common/international.aspx.
If you are supplementing a version of the software without media player functionality, the following license terms describe additional use terms for this supplement and new use terms for the software.  These terms and the license terms for the software apply to your use of the supplement.  If there is a conflict, these supplemental license terms apply.

BY USING THIS SUPPLEMENT, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS.  IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE THIS SUPPLEMENT.

If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.

1.	INSTALLATION OF ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS.  The installer for the supplement will download and install certain additional components related to media functionality from Windows Update.

2.	INTERNET-BASED SERVICES.  Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the software.  It may change or cancel them at any time.
	a.	Consent for Internet-Based Services.  The software features described below connect to Microsoft or service provider computer systems over the Internet.  In some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they connect.  You may switch off these features or not use them.  For more information about these features, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=74356.  By using these features, you consent to the transmission of this information.  Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you.

		Computer Information.  The following features use Internet protocols, which send to the appropriate systems computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of operating system, browser and name and version of the software you are using, and the language code of the device where you installed the software.  Microsoft uses this information to make the Internet-based services available to you.

·	Windows Media Digital Rights Management.  Content owners use Windows Media digital rights management technology (WMDRM) to protect their intellectual property, including copyrights.  This software and third party software use WMDRM to play and copy protected content.  If the software fails to protect the content, content owners may ask Microsoft to revoke the software's ability to use WMDRM to play or copy protected content.  Revocation does not affect other content.  When you download licenses for protected content, you agree that Microsoft may include a revocation list with the licenses.  Content owners may require you to upgrade WMDRM to access their content.  Microsoft software that includes WMDRM will ask for your consent prior to the upgrade.  If you decline an upgrade, you will not be able to access content that requires the upgrade.  You may switch off WMDRM features that access the Internet.  When these features are off, you can still play content for which you have a valid license.

·	Windows Media Player.  When you use Windows Media Player, it checks with Microsoft for
·	compatible online music services in your region;
·	new versions of the player; and
·	codecs if your device does not have the correct ones for playing content.
You can switch off this last feature.  For more information, go to http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=74356.
